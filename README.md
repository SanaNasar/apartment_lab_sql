SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

How SQL works is it understands fields that are in tables, and how to find the data in the tables based on the contents of the fields. All SQL operations are then one of four general things you do to tables:

Create:
=================
Putting data into tables.
Read:
=================
Query data out of a table.
Update:
=================
Change data already in a table.
Delete:
=================
Remove data from the table.

This has been given the acronym "CRUD" and is considered a fundamental set of features every data storage system must have. In fact, if you can't do one of these four in some way then there better be a very good reason.

SQL working is explained by comparing it to a spreadsheet software like Excel:

A database is a whole spreadsheet file.
A table is a tab/sheet in the spreadsheet, with each one being given a name.
A column is a column in both.
A row is a row in both.
SQL then gives a language for doing CRUD operations on these to produce new tables or alter existing ones.
The last item is significant, and not understanding this causes people a lot of headaches.
SQL only knows tables, and every operation produces tables. It either "produces" a table by modifying an existing one, or it returns a new temporary table as your data set.
